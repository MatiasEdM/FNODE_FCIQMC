MAXIMUM RANGE: 68 | JASTROW[67]+BACKFLOW[68]
CURRENTLY    : RUN20 is continuation of RUN20.

RUN19 continuation of RUN18.
RUN18 is checking of convergence [no max_iter].
RUN17 is continuation of RUN16 (max_niter: 2) [convergence] (WARNING: at this point the Jastrow may introduce renormalization due to MaxRange-1).
RUN16 jastrow[55]+backflow[55] -> jastrow[67]+backflow[68] (max_niter: 2): not ocnverged.
RUN14 jastrow[45]+backflow[45] -> jastrow[55]+backflow[55] (converged).
RUN13 is continuation of RUN12 jastrow[45]+backflow[45] with MaxIter 1 and MaxCyc 7 ConCyc 3 - CONVERGED.
RUN12 is check for convergence on jastrow[45]+backflow[45] with MaxIter 1 and MaxCyc 7 ConCyc 3 (at the end need to check if it does somethng or need to rewind). 
RUN11 is continuation of RUN10 MaxCyc 5; ConvCyc 3 and OptStep 3 (converged:.
RUN10 is continuation of RUN9 MaxCyc 5; ConvCyc 3 and OptStep 3 (only 3 Cyc have occured).
	NOTE: what can be done if RUN10 does not provide anything is to run with MaxIter 1 and MaxCyc 7 ConCyc 3.
RUN9 jastrow[35]+back-flow[35] ->  jastrow[45]+back-flow[45] MaxCyc 5; ConvCyc 3 and OptStep 3 
RUN8 continuation RUN7 jastrow[35]+back-flow[25] ->  jastrow[35]+back-flow[35] w/ MaxCyc 5; ConvCyc 3 and OptStep 3 (only 3 Cyc. have been excecuted).
RUN7 jastrow[35]+back-flow[25] ->  jastrow[35]+back-flow[35] w/ MaxCyc 5; ConvCyc 3 and OptStep 3.
RUN6 is continuation of  RUN5 jastrow[35]+back-flow[25] w/ MaxCyc 5(to continue and look for convergence); ConvCyc 3 and OptStep 3 : converged.
RUN5 jastrow[35]+back-flow[15] ->  jastrow[35]+back-flow[25] w/ MaxCyc 5; ConvCyc 3 and OptStep 3.
RUN4 converged.
RUN4 is continuation of RUN3/RUN2 because it hasn't coverged yet. Before we use OptStep 1 now is increased to 3.
RUN3 is continuation of RUN2 (same optimization step) adding back-flow[15] to jastrow[35] and finishing MaxCyc 10 and ConvCyc 3.
